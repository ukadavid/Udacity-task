                    Dream destinations to visit this year in Paris, France
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I returned home from my first trip to Paris. I felt so happy, confident, and alive. My whole life changed during that week. I had never felt the support of so many people. Going to Paris that first time opened me up to a whole new world. The confidence to go places and do things by myself. To put myself out there and meet other people. I was good enough for other people to like. I felt validated. It provided long lasting friendships with people that I would have never met. Soul sisters and mentors. Models for what I wanted my life to look like.

                    I had decided 7 years prior that I was going to set up a little savings account (AKA the Paris Fund). You see, I had worked with a girl my age who suddenly one day had a brain aneurysm and ended up in a nursing home with no life whatsoever. She actually passed away a few years later. This scared the hell out of me. I actually didn't really get along with her. We had been almost friends years earlier, but after some work issues, we really no longer got along. She never knew that it was because of her that I decided to begin saving for Paris.  Life is too short and you can get it ripped from you at any time. You need to take what you can. Do what you want. For me my dream was to go to Paris.
